For the material that you might need to finish up this assignment, please consult our class on canvas.

question1
=========== 
here is what you need to do: create a file with your project proposal,
I need another file with all the classes that your program is going to have 
and the relationship between those classes.Create a file for each of your classes, 
in that file,specify the instance variables of that class and for each method in the class write pseudo code of each.

After that still in the same file,
write how you would test that class and different scenarios that you will test I need at least 5 scenarios for each class /30

Here is how you will be graded:

Having all the needed classes in your project /3

Having each class well designed and pseudo code well written /15
Having at least 5 test cases for each class /12

question 2
===========

This question is simple, since you have everything designed on paper,
what you have to do is to code everything you wrote and all the tests./ 40

Here is how you will be graded:
Code following the written design: 10
Code running perfectly:10
Tests passing:10
code well commented and clean:10

question 3 /30
============
This is our last question, we are going to test how well we can manage exceptions that occur in our code.
And as a plus feel free to implement any other features that you feel you want to add to your project , go crazy , go wild and amaze me :)

Also take a video of you interacting with you application and explaining the code a little bit.

Here is how you will be graded:
Having all the exceptions handled: 10
video:20

Bonus.
Implementing additional features : 10 this will be bonus
